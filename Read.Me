# 📊 Power BI Project – Sub-Category Sales by Region (KPI & YTD Analysis)

## 🧩 Problem Statement
The leadership team has set a **target sales figure of ₹200,000** and wants to monitor whether this target is being met.  
This project uses **Power BI Desktop** with **DAX measures** and **Excel data** to analyze sales performance and create KPI insights.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Create a **KPI visual** to compare **Total Sales** with the **Target Value (₹200,000)**.  
2. Build a **DAX measure** to calculate **Year-to-Date (YTD) Sales** and display it in a **Card or Bar Chart** for trend analysis.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft Power BI Desktop**
- **Microsoft Excel (Data Source)**
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**

---

## 🧮 DAX Measures Used

### 🔹 Total Sales
```DAX
Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Sales Amount])
````

### 🔹 Target Sales

```DAX
Target Sales = 200000
```

### 🔹 Year-To-Date (YTD) Sales

```DAX
YTD Sales = TOTALYTD(
    SUM(Sales[Sales Amount]),
    Sales[Date]
)
```

2. Create DAX measures (Total Sales, Target Sales, YTD Sales).
3. Add a **KPI visual** to compare total sales vs target.
4. Add a **Card** or **Bar chart** to display YTD Sales.
